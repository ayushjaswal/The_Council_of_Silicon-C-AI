[14:32:22] SCANNER: PARADOX DETECTED - Black hole emitting structured signals?
            This violates standard astrophysical models.
            Querying Archivist for precedents...

STEP 2: CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS - QUARTERMASTER AGENT EVALUATES RESOURCES
================================================================================

[14:32:29] QUARTERMASTER: Received alert from Scanner. Analyzing resource constraints...

[14:32:30] QUARTERMASTER: Current Resource Status:
            - Fuel: 15% (Critical Low)
            - Life Support: 87% (Nominal)
            - Shield Integrity: 94% (Nominal)
            - Probe Inventory: 3 units available

[14:32:31] QUARTERMASTER: Evaluating proposed action scenarios...

[14:32:32] QUARTERMASTER: SCENARIO A - High-Thrust Evasive Maneuver
            Fuel Cost: 12%
            Remaining Fuel: 3%
            Risk Assessment: UNACCEPTABLE
            Status: ❌ VETOED
            Reason: Remaining fuel (3%) insufficient to reach nearest refueling station
                    (requires minimum 8% for emergency warp to Outpost Kepler-442b)

[14:32:33] QUARTERMASTER: SCENARIO B - Maintain Current Course (Passive Observation)
            Fuel Cost: 0.5% per hour
            Remaining Fuel: 14.5% after 1 hour
            Risk Assessment: MODERATE
            Status: ✅ VIABLE
            Caveat: Does not address potential threat or opportunity

[14:32:34] QUARTERMASTER: SCENARIO C - Deploy Remote Probe
            Fuel Cost: 0.2% (probe launch)
            Probe Inventory Cost: 1 unit
            Remaining Fuel: 14.8%
            Remaining Probes: 2 units
            Risk Assessment: LOW
            Status: ✅ OPTIMAL
            Benefits: Gathers data without risking ship, minimal resource expenditure

[14:32:35] QUARTERMASTER: SCENARIO D - Slow Approach (Low-Thrust Investigation)
            Fuel Cost: 2.5% (approach + safety margin)
            Remaining Fuel: 12.5%
            Risk Assessment: MODERATE-HIGH
            Status: ⚠️  CONDITIONAL
            Condition: Requires Navigator approval due to crew safety implications

STEP 3: ORCHESTRATION - STRATEGIST AGENT SYNTHESIZES CONFLICTING INPUTS
================================================================================

[14:32:37] STRATEGIST: Received inputs from Scanner and Quartermaster.
            Detecting conflict between opportunity and constraint...

[14:32:38] STRATEGIST: Input Analysis:
            - Scanner recommends: CAUTIOUS_INVESTIGATION
            - Quartermaster vetoes: HIGH_THRUST_EVASIVE_MANEUVER
            - Quartermaster recommends: DEPLOY_PROBE
            
            Conflict Type: OPPORTUNITY vs SAFETY vs RESOURCE_SCARCITY

[14:32:39] STRATEGIST: Initiating LangGraph deliberation cycle...

[14:32:40] STRATEGIST [CYCLE 1]: Hypothesis - "Singing Black Hole" may be first contact scenario
            Question: Is the gravitational reading accurate, or could it be sensor error?
            
[14:32:41] STRATEGIST → SCANNER: VERIFICATION_REQUEST
{
  "request_type": "sensor_recalibration",
  "target": "gravitational_wave_detector",
  "reason": "Confirm black hole classification before committing resources"
}

[14:32:42] SCANNER: Recalibrating gravitational wave detector...
            Running diagnostic sequence...

[14:32:44] SCANNER → MCP_SERVER: read_gravitational_waves(frequency=0.3)

}

[14:32:46] STRATEGIST [CYCLE 2]: Gravitational anomaly confirmed.
            Question: Can we investigate without violating fuel constraints?
            
[14:32:47] STRATEGIST: Evaluating Quartermaster's proposed scenarios...
            - DEPLOY_PROBE: Low risk, low cost, moderate information gain
            - SLOW_APPROACH: Higher risk, higher cost, high information gain
            
            Decision Framework: Dialectical Synthesis
            Thesis: "Investigate to maximize discovery potential"
            Antithesis: "Preserve resources to ensure survival"
            Synthesis: "Deploy probe first, reassess based on findings"

[14:32:48] STRATEGIST: Consulting Navigator for policy compliance check...

            - Prime Directive: N/A (no confirmed sentient life detected yet)
            - Safety Protocol 7.3: Crew safety prioritized ✅
            - Resource Management Protocol 4.1: Fuel reserves adequate ✅

{
  "status": "APPROVED",
  "decision_mode": "COMMAND_DECISION",
  "reasoning": "Probe deployment aligns with all applicable protocols. No crew debate required.",
  "additional_requirements": [
    "Maintain minimum safe distance of 10 AU from event horizon",
    "Prepare emergency warp protocols in case of hostile action",
    "Continuous monitoring of gravitational fluctuations"
  ]
}

[14:32:52] STRATEGIST [CYCLE 3]: Navigator approval received.
            All agents aligned on DEPLOY_PROBE strategy.
            
            Final Decision Matrix:
            - Risk: LOW (probe is expendable, ship remains at safe distance)
            - Cost: MINIMAL (0.2% fuel, 1 probe unit)
            - Information Gain: MODERATE-HIGH (probe sensors can analyze both phenomena)
            - Alignment: UNANIMOUS (Scanner, Quartermaster, Navigator all support)

[14:32:53] STRATEGIST: Decision reached through dialectical synthesis.
            Proceeding to resolution phase...

            Warp drive on standby.
            Safe distance maintained: 15.3 AU from anomaly.

[14:32:58] QUARTERMASTER: Probe-Delta-7 launch sequence initiated...
            T-minus 10 seconds...

[14:33:08] QUARTERMASTER: 🚀 PROBE LAUNCHED
            Trajectory: Optimal

[14:33:10] STRATEGIST: Mission status: IN_PROGRESS
            Decision rationale summary:
            
            "Faced with a paradoxical phenomenon—a black hole emitting structured 
            radio signals—the Starship Dialectic's agent council employed dialectical 
            synthesis to navigate conflicting imperatives. The Scanner identified an 
            unprecedented opportunity (potential first contact), while the Quartermaster 
            imposed hard constraints (fuel scarcity). Through iterative deliberation, 
            the Strategist verified sensor accuracy, consulted historical precedents 
            via the Archivist, and obtained Navigator policy approval. The synthesis: 
            deploy a low-cost probe to gather intelligence without risking crew or 
            depleting critical fuel reserves. This decision honors both the spirit of 
            exploration and the pragmatism of survival."

[14:33:11] NAVIGATOR: All systems nominal. Awaiting probe data.
            Crew morale: Cautiously optimistic
            Bridge status: Yellow Alert maintained
